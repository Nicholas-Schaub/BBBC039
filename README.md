# Data Summary
This image set is part of a high-throughput chemical screen on U2OS cells, with examples of 200 bioactive compounds. The effect of the treatments was originally imaged using the Cell Painting assay (fluorescence microscopy). This data set only includes the DNA channel of a single field of view per compound. These images present a variety of nuclear phenotypes, representative of high-throughput chemical perturbations. 

## Images
This data set has a total of 200 fields of view of nuclei captured with fluorescence microscopy using the Hoechst stain. The images are stored as TIFF files with 520x696 pixels at 16 bits.
